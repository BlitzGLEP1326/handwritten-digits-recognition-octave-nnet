# Handwritten Digits Recognition, Neural Network    
####Experiment with handwritten digits recognition, with Octave neural network "nnet" package (or MATLAB Neural Network toolbox).    

Based on the Prof. Andrew Ng (Stanford)'s Machine Learning course.

**Note:** This is NOT solution to the course's assignment. This is merely my personal experiment to the same problem, in smaller scale, by utilizing Octave package / MATLAB toolbox.
